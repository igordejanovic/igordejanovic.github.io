* Base information
- Professor: [[http://igordejanovic.net][dr Igor Dejanović]] (igord at uns ac rs)
- Both practical and theoretical parts of the course are handled by the course
  professor.
- Consultations may be scheduled via e-mail.

* Introduction to the field of DSLs
The best place to start is to read the blog post of Federico Tomassetti.
- [[https://tomassetti.me/domain-specific-languages/][/The complete guide to (external) Domain Specific Languages/]], published on [[https://tomassetti.me/][the
  author's blog]], February 2017.

* Course project
- Practical part of the course is fulfilled by implementing a DSL for the
  domain of student's choosing.
- The language must be implemented in [[https://github.com/textX/textX][textX]] using Python.
- It must have a code generator or interpreter.
- Optionally a Visual Studio Code plugin may be developed to make using the
  language easier. See the [[https://github.com/textX/textX-LS][textX-LS]] project.

* Theoretical part of the exam
Is fulfilled by oral exam. The student must show the basic knowledge of the DSL
field.

The examination is based on the Markus Völter's book (see the last slide).
Relevant chapters are:
 - Introduction to DSLs
 - Conceptual Foundations
 - Concrete and Abstract Syntax
 - Scoping and Linking
 - Constraints
 - Type Systems
 - Transformation and Generation

* Literature and resources
- M. Völter, [[http://dslbook.org/][/DSL Engineering: Designing, Implementing and Using Domain-Specific
  Languages/]]. 2013 (the book is a donationware)
- Federico Tomassetti, [[https://tomassetti.me/domain-specific-languages/][/The complete guide to (external) Domain Specific
  Languages/]], published on [[https://tomassetti.me/][the author's blog]], February 2017. (this post is the
  place to start if you don't know anything about DSLs).
- [[http://textx.github.io/textX/latest/][textX]] documentation and tutorials. Be sure to check two youtube videos.
- [[https://github.com/pyflies/pyflies][pyFlies]] is a more complex example of DSL in the field of psychological experiments.
