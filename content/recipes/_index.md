These posts are recipes, WIP notes, thoughts and tips about things I'm working
on. This kind of semi-baked content is usually called _exobrain_ or _brain dump_.
For years I've kept these note private but I realize that they could be useful
to others so I'll gradually move them here. I'll keep them updated and the
GitHub link provided will show the updates.
