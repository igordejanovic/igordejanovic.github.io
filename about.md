<img style="margin: 10px;" align="left" src="/img/profile.jpg"/> I work as an assistant professor at the Faculty of technical sciences, University of Novi Sad.  When I was a kid I got struck by a passion for programming and computers in general.  That passion never left me.  Nowadays I am particularly interested in Domain-Specific Languages and Model-Driven Engineering.  I strongly believe that the future of programming is in the languages fit for the purpose, with both abstract and concrete syntaxes fully aligned with the domain.  I always strive for simplicity - simple tools, simple processes.

I am user, supporter, and developer of Free/Libre Open-Source Software. Check out my FLOSS projects at [github]({{ site.github }}).

Some of my research is listed at [my university page](http://informatika.ftn.uns.ac.rs/IgorDejanovic/).
