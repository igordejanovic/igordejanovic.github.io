title: About me 
---


I work as an assistant professor at the Faculty of technical sciences, University of Novi Sad.
When I was a kid I got inflicted with passion for programming and computers in general.
That passion never left me.
Nowadays I am particularly interested in Domain-Specific Languages and Model-Driven Engineering.
I strongly believe that the future of programming is in the languages fit for
the purpose, with both abstract and concrete syntaxes fully aligned with the domain.
I always strive for simplicity - simple tools, simple processes.

I am user, supporter, and developer of Free/Libre Open-Source Software.
